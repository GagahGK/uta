Hoshi no nai naki tsukareta yoru ni 
Fukai mori ni mayoikonde 
Usugurai michi o nuke chiisana 
Akari o sagashite aruita 


Don'nani tsuyoi teki ga dete mo 
Bokunara kateru hazu datte 
Hitasura tada tachimukatte mo 
Omoidōri ni ikanakute 


Kizutsuku koto ga kowaku natte 
Iiwake no tate ga fuete iku 
Akirame raretara rakunanoni 
Boku wa son'na yuuki mo nakute… 


Kotae o sagashite mata mayotte 
Mada happii endo wa tōikedo 
Kitto itsuka tadori tsukeru yotte 
Mogai teru boku o shinjinakucha


Tatakau tame ni furikazashita 
Ha wa boku o muite iru nda 
Honto wa mou kidzuite ita nda 
Teki wa boku no naka ni iru koto Bye Bye 


Kidzukeba doko ka de mita youna 
Fukai mori ni mayoikonde 
Itsu demo tesaguri de susunde 
Mayou no wa mou nan-domeda… 


Soredemo boku wa kono sekai de 
Itsumo nanika o sagashite kita 
Iku ate nante naikedo mou 
Kōkai dake wa shitakunaikara 


Yowakina mou hitori no jibun ga 
Boku no mukau michi o haban demo 
Don'na kakugo yori katai ken de 
Furiharatte mae ni susumanakucha


Yoku aru otogibanashi mitai ni 
Tada happii endo o mattete mo 
Itsu made mo konai koto gurai wa 
Kon'na boku demo wakatterukara 



Sukoshidemo mae ni mae ni aruite kita koto 
Itsu datte mayoinagara susunde kita koto


Kakko waruku tatte ii nda 
Kirei janakutatte ii nda 
Boku no monogatari o jibun no michi o ippoippo susumetanara 
Mou don'na toki mo… 

Kotae o sagashite mata mayotte 
Mada happii endo wa tōikedo 
Kitto itsuka tadori tsukeru yotte 
Mogai teru boku o shinjinakucha


Tatakau tame ni furikazashita 
Ha wa boku o muite iru nda 
Honto wa mou kidzuite ita nda 
Teki wa boku no naka ni iru koto Bye Bye

In a starless, weary night
I wandered into deep into a forest 
Walking through a gloomy road, 
As I search for a Small light


No matter how strong-natured they are
Since it’s me, I should be able to win 
But even if I keep facing forward 
It just won’t go my way


I’m afraid of getting hurt 
So I build up my wall of excuses 
Even though it’d be easier to just give up 
I don’t even have that much courage…


I lose myself as I search for an answer 
And a Happy End is far, far away 
But I tell myself that surely, I’ll reach it soon 
I’ve got to struggle and believe in myself!


The sword I brandished to fight 
Is pointing right at me 
The truth is, I’ve already realized 
That the enemy is within me; 
Bye Bye…

Once I realized, I’d wandered 
Deep into a somewhat familiar forest 
I continue to stumble forward 
How many times have I gotten lost…


But even so, I’ve always 
Been searching for something in this world 
I don’t have a destination in mind but 
I just don’t want to regret anything…


There’s a part of me that’s cowardly 
And blocks the path I choose, but 
Brushing it off with a sword that’s far stronger 
Than its resolution, I have to move forward…


It’s almost like a common fairy tale 
That there’s just a Happy End, waiting for me 
But, even I know that 
There’s no such thing…


Walking forward, forward 
Just a little 
Always, moving forward 
While lost


I don’t have to be cool 
I don’t have to be perfect 
All I have to do is walk forward 
On my path, on my story, 
At all times…

I lose myself as I search for an answer 
And a Happy End is far, far away 
But I tell myself that surely, I’ll reach it soon 
I’ve got to struggle and believe in myself!
