Romaji Lyrics			Translation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Odoriba no mado kara  hitonami wo nagameteita
Bokura wa doko e ikou ka  kaidan no tochuu de
			I was looking at the skylines from the window of the corridor
			Where should we go? Asking in the middle of the stairs
			
Futashika na kotoba wo tazusaete  kokyuu wo soroete hajimemashite
Sonde aisareta no nara daikangei kurikaeshi mukae tooku mukou e
			Bearing uncertain words, matching our breaths and a "nice to meet you"
			If that means we'll be loved, it's highly appreciated- repeat it and go further
			
Kekkyoku bokura wa sa  nanimono ni naru no kana
Mayoi inu mitai de ita  kaidan no tochuu de
			In the end, who will we become?
			Asked so when we were like lost dogs in the middle of the stairs
			
Daitan futeki ni warattatte  shinzou wa mada furueteite
Soredemo mata anata ni aitakute  hetakuso demo mukae tooku mukou e
			Even if I laugh boldly, my heart still trembles
			But still wanting to meet you, even if I'm bad at things, let me go further
			
Daikonyakusha de ii to shite  daihondoori odorenakute
Tada massugu dan wo notte ike  wakacchaitatte machibouke
Mitto mo nai to waratte kure  boku ni namae wo tsukete kure
Odoriba no mado ni se wo mukete  mae wo mite mukae tooku mukou e
			Even if it's okay to be a lousy actor, I still can't dance according to the script
			Just keep climbing up the steps; even though I understand, I keep waiting
			Laugh at me saying I'm pathetic, give me names
			Turn your back to the window of the corridor, look forward and go further
