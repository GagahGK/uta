Boku no shinzou ga ne, tomaru koro ni wa ne
Kitto kono yo wo ne, mankitsu shi owatteiru to omou'n da
			You know, when my heart stops beating
			I'm sure it must have fully enjoyed this world
			
Yarinokoshita koto, nannimo nai kurai
Kimi no tonari de sa, waraitsuzuketeitai to omou'n da
			I want to continue smiling by your side
			So that I won't have any regret when the time comes
			
Kono mune ga myaku utsu uchi wa kimi wo mada mamotteitai
Ikiru imi nante sore de ii no (ii no)
Mou hitotsu, mou hitotsutte onaji namida wo kazoete
Bokura wa mata otagai wo shiru'n da
			As long as my heart is still beating, I want to protect you
			That's enough of a reason for me to live
			As we count the same tear over and over again,
			We will understand each other a little more
			
Takanaru kodou ga tsutaeteku
Kasanaru oto to nagareru omoi wo
Mou hanasanai to yakusoku shiyou
Itsudemo kimi ga samishikunai you ni
			My racing heartbeats tell me
			Of these synchronizing sounds and streaming thoughts
			Let me promise never to leave you
			So that you won't ever have to feel lonely
			
Boku no shinzou wa ne, ippunkan ni ne
Nanajuu kai no ne, "ikiteiru" wo sakenderu'n da
			You know, every minute
			My heart shouts &quot;I'm living&quot; 70 times
			
Demo kimi to iru to, sukoshi kakeashi de
Hyakujuu kai no ne, "aishiteiru" wo sakebu'n da
			But when I'm with you, it's in just a little hurry
			And shouts &quot;I love you&quot; 110 times
			
Kono mune ga myaku utsu uchi wa kimi wo mada mamotteitai
Ikiru imi nante sore de ii no (ii no)
Mou ichido, mou ichidotte onaji kokoro wo kasanete
Bokura wa mata otagai wo shiru'n da
			As long as my heart is still beating, I want to protect you
			That's enough of a reason for me to live
			As we bring our feelings together, over and over again
			We will understand each other a little more
			
Boku to kimi ga deaeta koto ni
Nani ka riyuu ga aru to suru naraba
Unmei ka wa wakaranakute mo
Ureshii koto ni kawari wa nai yo ne
			If there has to be a reason
			For us to have met each other
			Then I don't know if it's fate or not
			But that doesn't change the fact that we're happy about it
			
Itsuka boku wo yameru toki made
Ato nando "suki" to ieru no darou?
Koko ni irareru koto ni kansha shiyou
Tada ikiteiru koto ni arigatou.
			Until the time I can no longer be myself
			I wonder just how many times I can still say &quot;I love you&quot;
			So let me be grateful for the fact that I can be here
			Thank you, simply for the fact that I'm alive.
			
Takanaru kodou ga tsutaeteku
Kasanaru oto to nagareru omoi wo
Aishitsuzukeru to yakusoku shiyou
Shinpaku ga tomatte shimau made
			My racing heartbeats tell me
			Of these synchronizing sounds and streaming thoughts
			Let me promise to love you forever and ever
			Until my heartbeat completely stops
