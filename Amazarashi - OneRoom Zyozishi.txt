                in our ¥‎60,000-a-month apartment, we travel the world
                the burning city; the dried-up canal; the old man who stands still, stunned
                our one-room epic, via wireless LAN, speeds up indefinitely
                with that centrifugal force, it flipped and crashed
                a happiness that doesn’t keep its original shape --
                please sell that to me. please sell me a heart that can laugh
                today’s weather is apocalyptic. has the ideal of reliance withered too?
                the world’s ending, it’s ending soon
                emptiness, loneliness, that’s the new trend
                because i became sick of everything, i set fire to this room

                burn, burn, burn it all
                this city’s beautiful dawn, the memories that don’t fit it
                the dream of confronting tomorrow’s rematch in high spirits
                i’m defeated by the rain, defeated by the wind
                defeated by the snow, by summer’s heat
                even so, this guy called ‘life’ isn’t someone i should lose to
                that place you stand alone is practically a burned-out wasteland

silently, i stared at the flames. in the increasingly bustling street, like a silent movie’s slow-motion, the world looked ridiculous.
when the sirens sounded, i came back to my senses
surprised that there was a self i had to return to
ah, it seems i’m still allowed to be who i am
the confused passersby, lit intermittently by the red lamp;
outside, separated by a single frame of film, this town seems like a summer festival
just in the moment when i thought i couldn’t bear those smirks any longer
i was put into a chokehold. i, i yelled desperately
"don’t snuff it out! that’s my soul!"
 
burn, burn, burn it all
all the trash that’s built up until now; myself, who treasured that; the wretchedness of clinging to miracles
i’m defeated by the rain, defeated by the wind
defeated by the snow, by summer’s heat
even so, this guy called 'life’ isn’t someone i should lose to
that place you stand alone is practically a burned-out wasteland
 
in any case, the future is a terminal dead end. if you wish to find a new self
then completely burn the things of the past, until they turn to ash
 
burn, burn, burn it all
throw all the old things in
these flames that raise high upwards -- take it as a fire to light the way ahead
i’m defeated by the rain, defeated by the wind
defeated by the snow, by summer’s heat
even so, this guy called 'life’ isn’t someone i should lose to
 
burn, burn, burn it all
for the sake of meeting your new self
this flame that’s snuffed out by a sigh
this flame that’s extinguished by tears
i’m defeated by the rain, defeated by the wind
defeated by the snow, by summer’s heat
even so, this guy called 'myself’ isn’t someone i should lose to
that place you stand alone is practically a burned-out wasteland
