do-shitara  do-shitara
minna wo mamoreru ka na?
chotto matte! soudan suru yo
OTONA tte isogashii  isogashii
makaserarenai
souda  kono machi no koto wa
KARAAZU pawa- de  nantoka shiyou
			What should we do, what should we do
			So that we can protect everyone?
			Hang on a sec! We'll have a discussion
			Adults are so busy 
			We can't rely on them
			That's right, let's do something about this town 
			With Colors Power!
			
PIN PIN PINCHI wa totsuzen ni kuru yo
dakara! dakara? ARE da! sonae?
mainichi yudan dekinai yo
CHANSU to niteru yo ne  docchi daro
nayamu? nayameba? demo sa! tsumari!
yatte minakya wakannai
			All of a sudden we're in a pinch
			That's why! That's why? We'll do that! Preparations?
			We can't be this unprepared every day
			This looks like a chance, which should we take?
			Worried? If we worry? But you see! Basically!
			If you don't try it, you'll never know
			
KOKORO no heiwa tooi to
KOKORO no koe ga kikoeta
saa kossori to daitan ni
ganbacchae!
			I heard the voice of my heart saying 
			Peace is so far away
			Stealthily but boldly
			We'll do our best!
			
donna toki  donna toki
omoshiroku nacchau kai?
motto motto shirabenakya
OTONA tte genki ka na  genki janai
KODOMO wa genki da
jaa sa  zenbu omakasete
KARAAZU pawa- de  katsuyaku shiyou
			When oh when
			Do things get interesting?
			We have to keep investigating more
			Are adults lively? Not at all
			Kids are lively!
			That's why leave it all to us
			With Colors power let's do our part

mainichi tabun tsuzukanai
SHOKKU na koto ga okita hi ni wa
ashita no tame ni  nemasho  guuguu
sonna kanji...nantoka nare!
			We'll train our body with jumps
			Stronger! Stronger? Fight! It hurts?
			We probably can't keep this up every day
			When something shocking happens
			For the sake of tomorrow, let's sleep Zzz
			Or something like that!
			
MIRAI no shinpai yori mo
mazu wa kyou no jiken kara
yoshi kaiketsu shinakutemo
ganbacchae!
			Instead of the worries of the future
			Let's start with today's case
			Even if we can't resolve it
			We'll do our best!

			Waiting in the park
			I can hear the sounds of sunset*
			Hey, if we're tired of waiting can we go home?
