                                                    What’s the point of living?
                                                    Is having a morning cup of coffee reason enough?
                                                    Or maybe live one thousand and one nights as a drunk,
                                                    though I think I’d throw up after the second.

                                                    I moved into a brand new house, but the sun in the West is still my old friend.
                                                    Peace of mind comes when you live a completely isolated life, but dreamers never get either.
                                                    The sights in my memories are fuzzy. The days look short with some old black-and-white film.
                                                    My body’s all drenched in blood from when I killed myself over and over, yet my soul’s alive and kicking.
                                                    The face in the window at night, a specter out to haunt me, tells me with a bitter look in his eyes.
                                                    “You’re free to come on back over here anytime.” It takes all my strength just to remain on this side.
                                                    I always manage to prove my own values wrong in this word game just so I can refuse him.
                                                    If you peel back the face I show to everyone, you’ll find a poor excuse for a person beneath.
                                                    Because of course you will. You would for anyone. In the end, we’re not much better than other animals.
                                                    The culprit was really me all along. I feel like that’s a punchline I’ve heard so many times!

                                                    In a single moment, in a single instance, with a flash lives are changed forever.
                                                    But I don’t think that flash is some god who deserves our veneration.
                                                    My honest sense of self-worth knelt before reality. That blues number really cut to my core.
                                                    I say I’m grateful to that life-changing flash, but that might just be a cover for my own laziness.
                                                    I just want to get back at those who made fun of me. Just another show off. Just an empty narcissist.
                                                    We compete with others to chase after tomorrow. We’re all ashamed of these lifeless lives of ours.
                                                    No matter how you look at it, everyone’s the underpinning for the plans of the masses.
                                                    And if that’s the case, then let’s all show them which one of us can wag our tails the fastest!

                                                    A wharf is needed at the deserted breakwater, though destined to rust by the ever-present sea breeze.
                                                    But that doesn’t mean we should quit before we try. We’ll hang on to the thought that it’s still worth doing.
                                                    I’ve nowhere to be, nowhere to call my home. It’s too much for my sputtering soul to handle.
                                                    So that my only regret is having nothing to regret, I’ll drag these heavy legs of mine along behind me.
                                                    Don’t you dare grumble. Don’t you dare complain. Don’t you dare think you’ll become a great person.
                                                    You’ve got to hold it in. Work yourself to the bone. Even if you’re lost, don’t you dare look back.
                                                    Be a good person, have a strong work ethic, return all your favors, and don’t think about having debt.
                                                    That’s unconditional love, but is that really love? Isn’t that just ego? God, how I hate that!
