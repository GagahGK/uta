-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
yuurei ni natta boku wa, asu tooku no kimi o mi ni yuku n'da
sono ato wa dou shiyou
kitto kimi ni wa ienai
			I've become a ghost, and tomorrow I'll go to see you, far away where you are
			And then what shall I do?
			I definitely can't tell you that
			
yuurei ni natta boku wa natsu no owarikata o mi ni yuku n'da
rokujou no chikyuu de
   asai kokage no BASUtei de
			I've become a ghost, and I'm going to see the way the summer ends
			On this studio-apartment-sized earth[1],
			   at a bus stop in the pale shadows of the trees
			
yoru ni suzumu kimi no te
   yuugatou ni sotte ishi o ketta
machi no usuakari ga yurete iru
			You kicked pebbles alongside the light trap [2]
			   with your hands growing cold in the night air
			The faint lights of the town waver
			
nani mo mienakutatte
nani mo iwanakutatte
daremo kidzukanakutatte
sore demo wakaru kara
			Because even without seeing anything,
			Even without saying anything,
			Even without anyone noticing,
			I still know
			
kimi to suwatte basutei
   miageta sora ga aoi koto shika wakarazu ni
			I only know that at the bus stop where I was sitting with you,
			   the sky I looked up at was blue
			
kumo ga tooi ne nee
yoru no kumo ga takai koto, hontou fushigi da yo
			The clouds are far away, see? See?
			It really is unbelievable that the clouds at night are so high
			
dakara sa, mou ii n'da yo
			So you see, it's all right now
			
yuurei ni natta boku wa, ano koro no keshiki o mi ni yuku n'da
tooi machi no umibe kodomo no toki mita rotengai
			I've become a ghost, and I'm going to see places from my past
			The beach in a distant town, the shopping stalls I saw as a child
			
arukitsukareta ashi de
   sokora no BENCHI de BASU o matte
sono ato wa dou shiyou
nande aruite'ta n'darou
			With feet tired from walking,
			   I'll sit on a bench nearby to wait for the bus
			And then what shall I do?
			Why was I walking?
			
nani mo shiranakutatte
nani mo kikenakutatte
itsuka kimi ga wasurete mo
sore demo mite iru kara
			Even if someday you forget
			Without knowing anything
			Without hearing anything
			Even so, I'll be watching you
			
natsu no kage ni suwatte nyuudougumo o nagameru dake de
   dokoka kurushikute
sora ga takai yo nee
			Just sitting in the summer shadows, staring at the storm clouds,
			   is somehow painful
			The sky is so high
			
kono mama zutto tooku ni iketara ii no ni na
yoru shika mou nemurezu ni
			I wish I could go far away just like this
			Now at night I only sleep
			
kimi to suwatte BASUtei
   miageta sora ga aoi koto shika wakarazu ni
			I only know that at the bus stop where I was sitting with you,
			   the sky I looked up at was blue
			
kumo ga tooi ne nee
yoru no kumo ga takai koto, hontou fushigi da yo
			The clouds are far away, see? See?
			It really is unbelievable that the clouds at night are so high
			
dakara sa, dakara sa
kimi mo sa, mou ii n'da yo
			So you see, so you see
			Even for you, it's all right now
			
yuurei ni natta boku wa, asu tooku no kimi o mi ni yuku n'da
sono ato wa dou darou
kitto kimi ni wa mienai
			I've become a ghost, and tomorrow I'll go to see you, far away where you are
			And then I wonder what I'll do
			You definitely won't be able to see me
